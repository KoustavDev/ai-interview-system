# **AI-Infused Interview System â€“ Documentation**

## **1. Project Overview**

The **AI-Infused Interview System** is a full-stack web application that streamlines the hiring process using **AI-powered asynchronous interviews**.

- **Recruiters** can post jobs, view applications, and review AI-generated interview reports.
- **Candidates** can browse jobs, apply with resumes, attend AI chatbot interviews, and access their reports.

The AI interviewer evaluates candidate responses based on job descriptions and resumes, then generates a structured interview report.

## **4. Database Design**

Instead of text tables, the **official ERD diagram** is available here:

ðŸ“Œ [ERD Diagram (PNG)](https://github.com/KoustavDev/ai-interview-system/tree/main/Frontend/public/images/ERD.png)

This diagram shows all relationships between `Users`, `Jobs`, `Applications`, `AIInterviews`, `AIChatMessages`, and `AIReports`.

---

## **5. API Documentation**

All backend endpoints are documented in Postman:

ðŸ“Œ [Postman API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/41937939/2sB3HtGxBq)

The Postman docs include:

- Authentication endpoints
- Candidate APIs (Jobs, Applications, Interviews, Reports)
- Recruiter APIs (Jobs, Applications, Reports)
- Request/response examples

---

## **6. AI Integration**

The system uses GPT-4 Turbo for:

1. **Asynchronous Chat Interviews** â€“ Context-aware Q\&A based on resumes and job descriptions.
2. **Interview Reports** â€“ Scoring (0â€“100), candidate evaluation, and summary.

AI conversation design ensures:

- One question at a time
- Professional tone
- Concise questions (<50 words)
- Completion signal `[INTERVIEW_COMPLETE]`

---

## **7. Caching Strategy**

- **Redis** is used for DB-level caching.
- **Cache TTL**:

  - Jobs: 10 minutes
  - Profiles: 15 minutes

- Cache is invalidated on updates/deletes.

---
